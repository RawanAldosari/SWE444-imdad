<p>
Mosques are regarded as sacred places in our Islamic culture, and for that, they require special care. So, while The Ministry of Islamic Affairs does its best, some matters can still fall out of their reach. Imdad establishes a direct link between mosques management and people of good will. As generosity is a key trait in our Islamic culture, sensible volunteering falls under said trait, as they both follow the same principle of selflessness and social solidarity, which we are in a dire need of. The 7th objective of Vision 2030 Quality of Life program supports those ideals, as it states: ‚ÄúPreserving and introducing the Kingdom‚Äôs Islamic, Arab and national heritage‚Äù [1].  Imdad will allow mosques to spread/broadcast/announce their needs such as maintenance.



Moreover, as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's interest came in the empowerment of volunteers as reflected in the Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program 2020, which targets for increasing the number of volunteers. In this regard, we encourage our country national qualifications to volunteer via Imdad, and through Imdad people are welcomed to volunteer with whatever is in their disposal to meet those needs. Volunteers can range from physically or financially capable individuals and cleaning and maintenance service who seek to serve their community. It could also serve as a platform for mosques to plan religious gatherings and in which people can volunteer to organize and participate in.
